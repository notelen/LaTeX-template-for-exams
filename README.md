A LaTeX Template for Exams

This GitHub Project is meant to provide a dummy template for exams in LaTeX. It
relies on a document class created by Philip S. Hirschhorn, for which he holds
the copyright.

Why bother creating an exam in LaTeX? Because the system will...

1. Calculate the total points 
2. Create a solutions manual
3. Automatically format the exam

It's not a big deal, but this system can make it slightly easier to put an exam
together.
