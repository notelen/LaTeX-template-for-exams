\myquestion[5] A small coffee company roasts coffee beans in its shop. 
The {\em total} cost of roasting coffee beans is $3q^2$ when
$q$ pounds are roasted. 
The smell of roasting beans imposes costs on the 
company's neighbors. The {\em total} amount that neighbors 
would be willing to pay to have the shop stop roasting 
altogether is $\frac{3}{2} \cdot q^2$. The company sells its output in a 
competitive market at \$36 per pound, so that its total revenue is $36q$. What is the 
socially efficient amount of coffee for the company to 
roast? 
	\begin{choices}
	\choice 2 pounds. 
	\CorrectChoice 4 pounds.
	\choice 6 pounds.
	\choice 8 pounds.
	\choice 10 pounds.
	\end{choices}

\myquestion[5] A monopolist has discovered that the inverse demand function of a
person with income M for the monopolistâ€™s product is $p = 0.002M - q$. The
monopolist is able to observe the incomes of its consumers and to practice price
discrimination according to income.
 The monopolist has a total cost function, $c(q) = 100q$. The
price it will charge a consumer depends on the consumer's income, $M$, according
to the formula
	\begin{choices}
	\choice $p = 0.002M - 100$
	\choice $p = M^2$
	\choice $p = 0.01 M^2 + 100$
	\CorrectChoice $p = 0.001M + 50$
	\choice None of the above.
	\end{choices}

\myquestion[5] An industry consists of two duopolist firms choosing their output
simultaneously.  They decide to enter into a secret agreement to maximize their
joint profits.  The {\em total} output of the industry then goes $[X]$ and the
price goes $[Y]$.
	\begin{choices}
	\choice $X =$ up, $Y =$ down
	\choice $X =$ up, $Y =$ up
	\choice $X =$ stays the same, $Y =$ up
	\choice $X =$ down, $Y =$ down
	\CorrectChoice $X =$ down, $Y =$ up
	\end{choices}

\myquestion[5] If the firm behaves competitively, taking price as given, what
level of output and price does it choose?
	\answerline

	\begin{solution}
	Bundle $B$.
	\end{solution}

\myquestion[5] If the firm acts as a monopolist, what level of output and price
does it choose?

	\begin{solution}
	Bundle $A$.

\myquestion[5] Suppose that a consumer considers coffee ($C$) and tea ($T$) to be perfect substitutes, but he
requires two cups of tea to give up one cup of coffee. This consumer's budget constraint
can be written as $2.5C + T = 10$. What should the consumer buy?
	\begin{choices}
	\choice 2 cups of tea and no coffee.
	\CorrectChoice 10 cups of tea and no coffee
	\choice 2.5 cups of coffee and no tea.
	\choice 4 cups of coffee and no tea.
	\choice none of the above.
	\end{choices}

\myquestion[5] The market demand curve is $D\left( p \right) = 20 - 16\cdot p$.  When
the price is \$1, what is the elasticity of demand?
\answerline

	\begin{solution}
	First, we calculate the elasticity of demand using the usual formula:
	$$ \frac{\partial D(p)}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p}{D(p)} = 
	-16 \cdot \frac{p}{20 - 16p}.$$
	If we plug in $p=1$, we find that the elasticity of demand is $-16 \cdot
	\frac{1}{20-16} = -4$.

\question Suppose that a consumer likes apples ($a$)
and bananas ($b$), and has utility function $u\left(a,\,
b\right)=a^{2/10} \cdot b^{8/10}$.
Suppose that apples cost \$10 a pound and that the consumer has \$100
to spend. Denote the price of bananas as $p$. 
	\begin{parts}
	\part[5] What is the consumer's budget constraint?

	\begin{solution}[2.5in]
	The consumer's budget constraint is $10a+pb\leq100$. 
	\end{solution}

	\part[5] What is the consumer's marginal rate of substitution. In 1--2
	sentences describe what this quantity represents, aside from just ``the
	slope of the indifference curve.''
	\begin{solution}[2.5in]
	The consumer's marginal rate of substitution is \[ -\frac{\partial
	u/\partial a}{\partial u/\partial b}=-\frac{\left(2/10\right)\cdot
	a^{-8/10}\cdot b^{8/10}}{\left(8/10\right)\cdot a^{2/10}\cdot
	b^{-2/10}}=-\frac{2}{8}\cdot\frac{b}{a}.\] Note that this {}``assumes''
	we're graphing apples on the horizontal axis.
	\end{solution}
	
	\clearpage

	\part[5] Setting the MRS equal to the slope of the budget constraint, find
	the consumer's optimal choice of apples in terms of bananas.

	\begin{solution}[3in]
	If we graph apples on the horizontal axis, then the MRS is as above,
	and the slope of the budget constraint is $-10/p$. So at the consumer's
	utility-maximizing choice of goods, we must have\[
	\frac{10}{p}=\frac{2}{8}\cdot\frac{b}{a},\]
	which in turn implies that $a^{*}=\frac{2p}{80}\cdot b$.
	\end{solution}

	\part[5] Plug this result into the budget constraint to find the consumer's
	demand for bananas.

	\begin{solution}[3in]
	Plugging in, we have\[
	10\cdot\frac{2p}{80}\cdot b+pb=100,\]
	which implies that \[
	b^{*}=\frac{100}{p\cdot\left(\frac{20}{80}+1\right)}=\frac{80}{p}.\]
	\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\myquestion Suppose that a competitive firm has production function $f\left(K,L\right)=\sqrt{KL}$,
in which $K$ denotes capital and $L$ denotes units of labor. The
firm must pay its workers sixteen dollars an hour, and must pay $r$
dollars per unit of capital. 
	\begin{parts}
	\part[5] Does the firm have constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to
	scale? Justify your answer.

	\begin{solution}[2in]
	Constant returns to scale: \[ f\left(2K,\,2L\right)=\sqrt{2\cdot
	K\cdot2\cdot L}=2\sqrt{K\cdot L}=2\cdot f\left(K,\, L\right).\]
	\end{solution}

	\part[5] Calculate the firm's technical rate of substitution (TRS). In
	1--2 sentences, describe what this quantity represents, aside from just
	{}``the slope of the isoquant.''

	\begin{solution}[2in]
	The firm's technical rate of substitution is \[ \frac{\partial
	f\left(K,\, L\right)/\partial K}{\partial f\left(K,\, L\right)/\partial
	L}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}K^{-0.5}L^{0.5}}{\frac{1}{2}\cdot
	K^{0.5}L^{-0.5}}=\frac{L}{K}.\] Note this assumes that capital is on the
	horizontal axis. 
	
	The TRS measures the firm's ability to substitute
	capital for labor while holding output constant.
	\end{solution}

	\part[5] Find the firm's conditional
	demand for labor, $L^{*}\left(r,y\right)$ in terms of the price
	of capital and the firm's choice of output.  (Hint: set the TRS equal to
	the slope of an iso-cost curve, and solve for capital in terms of labor.
	Then plug that result into the production function.)

	\begin{solution}
	The firm's iso-cost line is $C=16L+rK$. If capital is on the horizontal
	axis, then $L=\frac{C}{16}-\frac{r}{16}K$. So at the optimum level
	of inputs, we observe\[
	\frac{r}{16}=\frac{L}{K}.\]
	This implies that $K=\frac{16L}{r}$. Plugging this into the production
	function leads to $y=\sqrt{\frac{16L}{r}\cdot L}=4L\cdot r^{-1/2}$.
	So the conditional demand curve for labor is \[
	L^{*}=\frac{y}{4}\cdot\sqrt{r}.\]
	\end{solution}
	 
	\end{parts}
